ReasonableCare
==============

The Reasonable Care management system for CSC 540

Reasonable Care provides a means for students, doctors, and nurses to schedule doctor and receive medical care. 
It provides an interface for students to schedule appointments, search for doctors, and update their personal
information. Doctors may view their upcoming and past appointments, and nurses may help provide on-the-phone
consultations for students, as well as schedule appointments if necessary.
